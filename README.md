# React Employee App

This React App was completed in February 2018 to a client who wants to view sample data of a medium-sized company. Needless to say, the UI (user interface) works very well on both a Mobile and Desktop display. 

The purpose of this project was to create something informative and meaningful that the user could interact with on a basic, fundamental level. Although the data cannot be modified (it was not supposed to be modified, according to the instructions provided), the user is able to query results and filter them according to categories defined on the Side Bar, and the buttons found underneath each table on the Home Page. The Navigation Bar is also clickable, and returns the user to the root component, which contains the three main tables.

The data was fetched from a self-made API. Due to the way I have designed it, however, this App is capable of working with any API that exists. This is significant, because it essentially means that the App is versatile and can work with any data, so long as the data is clearly defined. The biggest challenge was not so much with retrieving said data, but rather making it look attractive to the end users who would eventually use it.

This was a very, very fun project to build as it really takes the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS and combines them together in a simple yet powerful way. More specifically, the reference wrappers were easy to make and felt natural as there were little complications with regards to the modularity. The App is its own component, and the other components help define the App.

I completed this project in less than 5 hours, which is lightning fast, all things considered. Had I attempted to build a project like this using HTML, CSS, and JS alone, it would have taken me much more time to complete it. For anything related to UI, I now know which software I would want to use to create it.

As a result of this project, I also became more familiar with the BootStrap and JQuery libraries, both of which were responsible for giving this App a high "sleek" feel to it. I am also a huge advocate of the "Linking" feature which reduces load times significantly when navigating through the different pages.

The final grade that I achieved on this project was an A+.
