# React Employee App

This React App was completed in February 2018 to anyone interested in a sample of Big Data. The UI (user interface) works very well on both a Mobile and Desktop display.


This was a very, very fun project to build as it really takes the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS and combines them together in a simple yet powerful way. More specifically, the reference wrappers were easy to make and felt natural as there were little complications with regards to the modularity. The App has its own component, and the other components help define.

I completed this project in less than 5 hours, which is lightning fast, all things considered. Had I attempted to build a project like this using HTML, CSS, and JS alone, it would have taken me much more time to complete it.

As a result of this project, I also became more familiar with the BootStrap and JQuery libraries, both of which were repsonible for giving this App a high "sleek" feel to it.

The final grade that I achieved on this project was an A+.
